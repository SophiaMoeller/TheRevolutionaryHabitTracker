# The Revolutionary Habit Tracker

This habit tracker can be used to track certain habits. It offers different functionality 
to analyze and display data in an easy-to-understand way. The user can enter and calculate various attributes 
for a certain habit such as a habit description, a periodicity in which the habit should be fulfilled, 
a group that is assigned to the habit to analyze habits in various areas of life, the creation date 
that indicates the date a habit was created at, as well as the current streak and the longest streak 
that can be calculated for each habit.

## What can it be used for?

Users can create new habits, increment habits and thus "check-off" their habits in the pre-described periodicity,
use different functionalities to analyze and display the habit, and delete existing habits and their respective data.
All the data is stored and managed in an SQL database.
